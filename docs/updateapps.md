# Update supported apps

## Using Update-Evergreen

After the Evergreen module is installed, the supported application functions need to be downloaded with `Update-Evergreen`. This function displays readable status that should work for an interactive session and non-interactive CI deployments (e.g. Azure Pipelines and Github Workflows).

::: warning
The Evergreen module requires the application functions and manifests to work. Ensure that you run `Update-Evergreen` as the first action after installing Evergreen.
:::

`Update-Evergreen` downloads the latest Evergreen apps and manifests release from the [eucpilots/evergreen-apps](https://github.com/EUCPilots/evergreen-apps) repository, unpacks the files and stores them locally.

This function supports the `-Force` parameter to force the download of the latest release of the per-application functions even if you already have these locally. This approach should enable the administrator to update Evergreen where the locally cached copies of the functions are perhaps broken.

When importing Evergreen where the local cache is out of date, you will be prompted to update:

### Updating to a specific release

The default behaviour of `Update-Evergreen` is to update the the latest release from the [eucpilots/evergreen-apps](https://github.com/EUCPilots/evergreen-apps) repository. There may be instances where you want to download a specific release instead of the latest. 

`Update-Evergreen` supports the `-Release` parameter. This accepts a release tag similar to `v25.10.02.22`. The -`Force` parameter is required then specifing a release:

```powershell
Update-Evergreen -Release "v25.10.02.22" -Force
```

## Update behaviour

Evergreen uses the following behaviour and rules when

* When the Evergreen module is imported, a check is made for the latest release and the administrator is notified whether the local cache is out of date.
* Running `Update-Evergreen` is required - the local cache is not automatically updated when the module is imported.
* When running `Update-Evergreen`, if the local cache is out of date, the cache is automatically updated to the latest release.
* If you make direct changes to the local cache, and the remote release and local cache versions match, `Update-Evergreen` will display the mismatched files, but will not perform an update. Run `Update-Evergreen -Force` to re-sync the local cache.
* If you download a specific Evergreen apps release, the local cache will be out of date. If you run `Update-Evergreen` again, the local cache will be updated to the latest release.

## Cache location

Evergreen stores application functions and manifests in the following locations:

* Windows - `%LocalAppData%\Evergreen`
* macOS and Linux - `~\.evergreen`

The current cache location can be returned with `Get-EvergreenAppsPath`:

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-EvergreenAppsPath
C:\Users\aaron\AppData\Local\Evergreen
```

## Set a custom cache location

A custom cache location can be set with the `EVERGREEN_APPS_PATH` environment variable. Configure this variable in the user or system context and ensure it points to a valid path.
